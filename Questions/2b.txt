Write a C/C++/Python/Java program that takes the hexdump data of IP and TCP packets(in any file format) as inputs and perform following operations:

1) For the IP packets highlighted in the captured Wireshark files (IP.png). Determine the following from the HexDump Window panel:  (10 marks)



a) Which IP version is used?
b) What is IP header length?
c) What is the total length of the IP packet?
d) Which transport layer protocol is embedded with the IP packet?
e) What is the value of 16 bit IP checksum?  
f) Determine the source and destination IP addresses.

2) For the TCP packets highlighted in the captured Wireshark files (TCP.png). Determine the following from the HexDump Window panel: (10 marks)

a) Determine the source and destination port numbers.
b) Determine the 32 bit Sequence number and Acknowledgement numbers of the TCP packet
c) Determine the header length of the TCP packet.
d) What is the value of 16 bit TCP checksum?
e) Determine which TCP header flags are set.



NOTES regarding implementation details::
1) Convert the Hex output from the HexDump Window panel of the given TCP and IP images into text files, so that it can be provided as input to your program.
2) All answers must be provided in decimal values. The IP and TCP header formats are provided as attachment for reference.
3) Upload your source code of your program and snapshots of your output to the Google classroom.
4) The TAs will use different set of inputs to evaluate your assignments.
5) Plagiarism will be penalized with deduction in assignment marks.
